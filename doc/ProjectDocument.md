# Title: College Meal Nutrition Planner  

# Project Summary
We plan to create an application where students can create and share their recipes, input their ingredients, and track the nutritional content of their meals. The app will provide dietary recommendations and community features to make it more engaging than existing solutions offered by existing applications that help track nutrition. The application targets college students who are not experienced in cooking and need better nutritional choices. The app will help college students learn easy and nutritious recipes while keeping track of their nutrients.
# Description of Application
Application Purpose: The application will serve as a comprehensive tool for college students to manage their dietary habits by allowing them to create, try out, and share recipes, track nutritional intake, and receive personalized dietary recommendations.

Problem: Many students face adversity in keeping a healthy diet after coming to college because it is complicated and there are other more convenient unhealthy substitutes available for them. 

Technically Challenging Function: Implementing a nutrition analysis functionality that evaluates user-generated recipes and provides personalized dietary recommendations and recipes based on the student's nutritional goals.
# Usefulness Description of Your Application
Why Useful: This application will support students looking to improve their dietary habits, promoting better health and well-being. It will offer insights into the nutritional value of user-generated recipes and help students make informed food choices.

Basic Functions: Users can create and share recipes, input ingredients, track their nutritional intake, and receive personalized dietary recommendations. Community features will allow users to share recipes.

Similar Applications: While similar to MyFitnessPal in tracking nutrition, this application differentiates itself by focusing on user-generated recipes, community engagement, and personalized dietary advice tailored for college students.
# Description of Your Data Sources (Realness)
Online Data Sources: Gather nutritional data from the USDA Food Composition Databases and allow users to input their ingredient data. Ensure data accuracy and regular updates.

User-Generated Sources: User-generated content created by group members can be used to test out the application and check whether it gives the correct suggestions. 
# Functionality Description of Your Application
Recipes: The user will be able to create, share, and view recipes. This will allow the users to be able to learn to cook easy healthy meals and also share the different health tips they have learned. 

Nutrition Tracker: Users will be able to track the different nutrients that they have consumed and if they consumed a recipe that was already on the app the tracker will be able to input the nutrients for them. 

Suggestions: Users will be suggested their dietary situation and also will be given a recipe that they can follow.
