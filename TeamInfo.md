## Project Summary
We plan to create an application where students can create and share their recipes, input their ingredients, and track the nutritional content of their meals. The app will provide dietary recommendations and community features to make it more engaging than existing solutions offered by existing applications that help track nutrition. The application targets college students who are not experienced in cooking and need better nutritional choices. The app will help college students learn easy and nutritious recipes while keeping track of their nutrients.
